This project is made for studying about the blockchain.

The process of creating Blockchain Address is based on the way of BTC.
In the real Blockchain Network, P2P protocol is used in the communication between blockchain servers. But this project is optimized for a demonstration by a single local computer or server, thus TCP is used.
In default, port 5000 is set for a blockchain server, port 8080 and gateway http://127.0.0.1:5000 is set for a wallet server. When you demonstarate sending cryotocurrency, you have to run server files in different port numbers and gateways.
Currently the wallet is not saved and connected to a database. And at the time of creating wallet, the balance is set as 0 whereby you can't send any cryotocurrency. You should get miners' blockchain address and other information to try to send any cryotocurrency.
